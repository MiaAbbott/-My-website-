  <p>
The sun is the only star in our solar system. It's the center of our solar system and holds everything together via gravity. It's star type is called yellow-dwarf. The sun is 4.5Billion years old and is 26,000 light years away from the galactic center. The Latin word for sun is "sol". <br> The sun is the largest object in our solar system and is 1.3 Million times the size of earth. The sun is made out of gas (hydrogen & helium). The sun doesn't actually have any solid surface as it is made out of plasma. The temprature of the sun's core is about 27 million degrees fahrenhiet.

  <p> Mercury is the fasted planet in the solar system & only takes 88 earth days to orbit the sun. From the surface of mercury, the sun appears 3x bigger than it does when looking at it from earth. Despite being closest to the sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet. It is Venus thanks to it's dense atmosphere. <br> Instead of an atmosphere, Mercury has a thin exosphere made of atoms from the surface of the surface of the solar wind.

  <p> Venus spins slowly around the sun. It's length of year is 225 days. An atmosphere traps heat making a greenhouse effect. So Venus is actually the hottest planet in the solar system.
